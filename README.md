##  About Me
I specialize in cybersecurity with a focus on ethical hacking, system-level programming, and secure tool development. All shared content and code are strictly educational and comply with ethical standards.

---

##  Areas of Interest
- **Offensive Security**: Red teaming, CTFs, and real-world exploit simulation  
- **Custom Tooling**: Building modular, stealthy, and effective cybersecurity tools  
- **Malware Development**: Simulating real-world attacks in lab environments to strengthen defenses  
- **Python & C/C++**: Security-focused development with performance in mind  

---

##  Current Learning Goals
- Advanced JavaScript for web vulnerability research  
- Cross-compilation and AV evasion techniques  
- Building automation with Docker for research environments

##  Methodology
I follow a research-driven approach: learning by breaking and building.  
Each project is designed to explore a specific concept — whether it's stealth, evasion, or system internals.  
I prefer clean, minimal, and modular code that's built for purpose, not show.
